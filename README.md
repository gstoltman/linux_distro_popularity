# Linux Distro Popularity

A data pipeline with Python Scraping, Spark Batching, dbt, Docker, Airflow, Terraform, and GCP

## Description

### Objective

The project will intake Linux Distribution page-hit data from Distrowatch and create a data pipeline that consumes the page-hit data per year, to generate some data and analytics regarding popular Linux Distros. The data coming in is generated by webscraping the yearly data on Distrowatch. The data is processed in batch format and stored to the data lake. The batch job will then consume this data, apply transformations, and create the desired tables for our dashboard to generate analytics. We will try to analyze metrics like top 10 distro of all time, .

### Dataset

[Eventsim](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) is a program that generates event data to replicate page requests for a fake music web site. The results look like real use data, but are totally fake. The docker image is borrowed from [viirya's fork](https://github.com/viirya/eventsim) of it, as the original project has gone without maintenance for a few years now.

Eventsim uses song data from [Million Songs Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com) to generate events. I have used a [subset](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset/#subset) of 10000 songs.

## Setup

**WARNING: You will be charged for all the infra setup. You can avail 300$ in credit by creating a new account on GCP.**
### Pre-requisites

If you already have a Google Cloud account and a working terraform setup, you can skip the pre-requisite steps.

- Google Cloud Platform. 
  - [GCP Account and Access Setup](setup/gcp.md)
  - [gcloud alternate installation method - Windows](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/windows.md#google-cloud-sdk)
- Terraform
  - [Setup Terraform](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/windows.md#terraform)


### Get Going!

A video walkthrough of how I run my project - [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/vzoYhI8KTlY)

- Procure infra on GCP with Terraform - [Setup](setup/terraform.md)
- (Extra) SSH into your VMs, Forward Ports - [Setup](setup/ssh.md)
- Setup Kafka Compute Instance and start sending messages from Eventsim - [Setup](setup/kafka.md)
- Setup Spark Cluster for stream processing - [Setup](setup/spark.md)
- Setup Airflow on Compute Instance to trigger the hourly data pipeline - [Setup](setup/airflow.md)


### Debug

If you run into issues, see if you find something in this debug [guide](setup/debug.md).
### How can I make this better?!
A lot can still be done :).
- Choose managed Infra
  - Cloud Composer for Airflow
  - Confluent Cloud for Kafka
- Create your own VPC network
- Build dimensions and facts incrementally instead of full refresh
- Write data quality tests
- Create dimensional models for additional business processes
- Include CI/CD
- Add more visualizations

### Special Mentions
I'd like to thank the [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club) for offering this Data Engineering course for completely free. All the things I learnt there, enabled me to come up with this project.
